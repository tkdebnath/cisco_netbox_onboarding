A Python script to streamline the onboarding of Cisco devices into [NetBox](https://netbox.dev/), a popular IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tool. This tool leverages the NetBox API to automate the creation of sites, devices, interfaces, and IP addresses based on a YAML configuration file.

## Overview

The `cisco_netbox_onboarding` script simplifies the process of adding Cisco network devices to NetBox. By defining device details in a YAML file, users can efficiently populate NetBox with accurate inventory data, reducing manual entry and potential errors. This is particularly useful for network engineers managing Cisco-powered infrastructures.

## Features

- **Automated Onboarding**: Creates NetBox objects (sites, devices, interfaces, IPs) from a YAML config.
- **Cisco-Focused**: Tailored for Cisco devices with platform support (e.g., `cisco_ios`).
- **Flexible Configuration**: Define multiple devices, interfaces, and IP assignments in a single YAML file.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the NetBox REST API for seamless data insertion.
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation and feedback for API interactions.
